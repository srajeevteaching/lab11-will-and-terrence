Lab 11

Problem
Accompanying this handout is the Python file lab11_recursion.py, which contains a program that measures the running time of recursive and iterative implementations of computing the n-th term of the Fibonacci sequence, and performing n random searches on a large, sorted list of integers. The recursive version of binary search is not implemented.

Instructions
Find the part of the program containing the empty binary_search_recursive function, which is marked with a comment containing the tag TODO. Using as reference the binary_search_iterative function found above it, use comments to write the algorithm for recursive binary search. Start by identifying the base cases. Then formulate the recursive ones.

Write the Python code corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps.

Write a small test case to verify that your implementation is working, add it to the main function, and run it. Once verified, comment this test out and include it in your final submission.

Run the program and, for each of the four functions available, find the smallest value of n that requires the computer to take at least 5 seconds to run. If a value you tried is taking too long to finish, click the stop button and re-run the program. Use comments at the end of the program to indicate which values you found for each of the four cases and how much time each took to run. Include the comments in your final submission Commit and push changes and check your repository on github.com to confirm your updates before leaving lab (even if not finished).

Note: This lab does not require a flowchart or test cases.
